<h1>Terms of Use</h1>
<h2>Definitions</h2>
<p>The "Site" is
the Long Civil Rights Movement
("LCRM") online pilot project in
which you are registering to participate
(<a href="https://lcrm.lib.unc.edu/voice/works">https://lcrm.lib.unc.edu/voice/works</a>). The Site is funded by the Andrew
W. Mellon Foundation (the "Mellon
Foundation") and the University of North Carolina at
Chapel Hill ("UNC") and is generally
described as a collection of publications and materials on civil
rights accompanied by a commenting feature that allows authors and
users to annotate the publications and materials and link to other,
related digitized materials.</p>
<p>The "Project
Partners" are University of North Carolina Press, the
University Library at UNC (the "University
Library"), UNC's Southern Oral
History Program ("SOHP") in Center
for the Study of the American South, and the Center for Civil
Rights ("CCR") at the University of
North Carolina Law School. The "Service
Provider" is the University Library, which hosts the
Site. The "Site Administrators" are
the LCRM Project staff and associates at UNC who work on the Site
on behalf of the Service Provider and the Project Partners. The
"Test Period" is defined by free
(unpaid) access to the Content (as defined below) for invited
users; the duration of the Test Period is initially designated as
March 2010 to December 2010 and may be changed without notice by
the Site Administrators. Your
"Account" is your registration
information, including your username and password, which gives you
access to the Site.</p>
<p>A "Work" is a
book, paper, conference presentation, report, manual, or other
genre of written document that is hosted on the Site and made
available by the Site Administrators for searching, reading, and
commenting. A "Comment" is an
annotation to a Work that you or another user might contribute to
the Site; a Comment may contain links to other sites, and it may
consist of a reply to another Site User's
Comment. The "Content" of the Site
consists of Works and Comments together.</p>
