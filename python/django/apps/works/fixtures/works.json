More broadly, she asks how individuals developed racial self-consciousness. Exploring relationships between public and private and between segregation, racial etiquette, and racial violence, Ritterhouse sheds new light on tradition and change in the South and the meanings of segregation within southern culture.</p>"

Particular emphasis is placed on the effect the exercise of boundary decision-making authority may have on the &ldquo;Invisible Fences&rdquo; theme of the UNC Center for Civil Rights conference. Two examples of such fences in the Missouri communities of Hayti Heights/Hayti and Meacham Park/Kirkwood are discussed, including the different ways that the exclusion issue was addressed (incorporation of Hayti Heights as a separate municipality; annexation by Kirkwood of the Meacham Park neighborhood). State laws governing the exercise of the annexation and incorporation powers are reviewed, including the use of administrative agencies or courts to make boundary decisions. The largely self-executing nature of local government boundary adjustment authority is explored. Applying the rationale of the Mount Laurel cases and the current Indiana incorporation statute, the article concludes with a recommendation that states place the boundary adjustment decision in the hands of county executives and require county executives to make specific findings, based on analysis of enumerated factors, that a proposed boundary adjustment is in the best interests of the territory involved.</p>"

For an entire year, the county's black citizens refused to send their children to school in protest of a desegregation plan that required closing two historically black schools in their remote coastal community. Hyde County blacks feared that school desegregation was undermining&#8212;rather than enhancing&#8212;the rich and vibrant educational heritage that had helped to sustain the black community since Reconstruction. This book is the story of one county's extraordinary struggle for civil rights, but at the same time it explores the fight for civil rights in all of eastern North Carolina and the dismantling of black education throughout the South.</p>"

Insisting that they were truly representative of the race's potential, black elites espoused an ethos of self-help and service to the black masses and distinguished themselves from the black majority as agents of civilization; hence the phrase &#8216;uplifting the race.&#8217; A central assumption of racial uplift ideology was that African Americans&#8217; material and moral progress would diminish white racism. But Kevin Gaines argues that, in its emphasis on class distinctions and patriarchal authority, racial uplift ideology was tied to pejorative notions of racial pathology and thus was limited as a force against white prejudice.</p>"

This paper provides an overview of the shifting landscape of magnet schools. First the paper addresses the changing context for magnet schools as the nation moves away from court-ordered busing to race-neutral student assignment policies under grants of unitary status. Next, the paper presents the case of Nashville, Tennessee, describing changes in magnet schools following the end of court-ordered desegregation and the change to unitary status. As a Southern city with a distinctive and historic role in the Civil Rights Movement, Nashville plays a prominent, widely recognized part in the national policy debates related to school desegregation, choice, and equity. The finals section of the paper considers future policy directions to help magnet schools achieve diversity set against the backdrop of new court decisions and the end of court-ordered desegregation.</p>"

In essays addressing health care, education, welfare, and housing policies, the contributors reassess the findings of the report in light of developments over the last thirty years, including the Los Angeles riots of 1992. Guided by a historical perspective, the contributors propose a new combination of economic and social policies to transform cities while at the same time improving opportunities and outcomes for inner-city residents.</p>"

In tracing the growth of Baptist churches from small outposts of radically democratic plain-folk religion in the mid-18th century to conservative and culturally dominant institutions in the 20th century, Harvey explores one of the most impressive evolutions of American religious and cultural history.</p>"

In addition to this substantive focus, the study addresses a fundamental issue salient to a wide array of research on education policy. Any non-experimental study that seeks to attribute academic development to school policies and practices faces serious questions of selection and unmeasured variable bias. Within the context of our present study, estimates of the effects of school racial composition on student learning may be spurious, reflecting instead other influences related to the characteristics of students, families, and the neighborhoods in which they live. Fortunately, the analytic approach and data structure employed here are able to distinguish cognitive development that occurs during the school year (when school, family, and neighborhood effects are in operation), from learning during the summer months (when school effects are absent).</p>"

            "description": "<p>Improving educational equity has long been a stated objective of state and federal educational policies, though in recent decades the basic assumptions and strategies used to pursue that objective have changed dramatically. Decades ago, when the federal government first began an active role in education, the low educational outcomes of disadvantaged students were seen as a social and economic problem that required wide ranging solutions. Today, it is viewed much more narrowly, and I argue incorrectly, as a school problem requiring only expanded effort, expectations, and skill from school personnel. This more narrow view is revealed through the design of accountability policies in the recent re-authorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, commonly known as No Child Left Behind. Though the use of incentives based on measurable outcomes has the potential to improve educational equity, the design of this particular accountability policy has important flaws and is based on false assumptions. Part of my argument is based on economic theories of incentive design and empirical evidence regarding the actual effects of incentives on students. The &ldquo;optimal&rdquo; incentives from the research literature are not the ones included in NCLB. First, the law does a poor job of using the available standardized test information to measure and reward what schools contribute to student achievement. Second, the law under-emphasizes outcomes, such as the likelihood of graduation from high school, that are arguably better than standardized test scores in predicting students&rsquo; long-term success. For both reasons, the law creates counter-productive incentives. These design problems arise from two false assumptions. The first, alluded to above, is that school failure is the only, or at least the main, cause of low achievement. If poor performance is due to schools, then there is no distinction between the school contribution to student learning and that caused by external factors. Likewise, there is no need to supplement accountability with other policies such as early childhood education and desegregation that improve the school learning environment or social policies that improve conditions for students outside of school. The second assumption is that the most important student outcome produced by schools is academic learning, which eliminates the need for outcome measures that go beyond standardized tests. I show that there is strong empirical evidence rejecting both assumptions. The problem is not only that the design and assumptions of accountability is leading to under-performance by students, but that the idea of accountability is becoming a substitute&mdash;instead of a supplement&mdash;for more proven approaches to equity. The next generation of accountability therefore must be based on a more accurate assessment of its potential if it is to genuinely improve equity for the next generation of students.</p>"

One major finding is that the amount of information about the health of immigrants is limited. Another is that the casual pathways by which segregation influences health are not fully understood. The paper thus includes suggestions about what we need to know and recommendations toward this end for both researchers and policymakers in the field of healthcare.</p>"

Black communities may also incorporate as separate towns in order to retain a sense of identity, to try to protect and increase the value of their properties, or to procure municipal services and rights denied to them by adjacent larger towns. Minority neighborhoods that are not incorporated (either by annexation or by self-incorporation) can suffer damaging effects (Johnson et al., 2003); yet successfully incorporation Black communities may face special challenges from surrounding communities as well.

            "description": "<p>In a land where education is supposed to be the great equalizer of opportunity, we would expect the schools to provide strong educational reinforcement to overcome the disadvantages of poverty. Yet, the evidence suggests that children born into poverty are likely to go to schools that do not overcome these disadvantages and may even reinforce them. The purpose of this paper is to review the relation between children in poverty and the curriculum that is awaiting them in school. By curriculum, we refer to the overall school experience that such children face, not just the topics and texts that represent the formal structure. That is, teacher capabilities and strategies, peer interactions, and school expectations are also important parts of the actual curriculum that affect child learning. In this paper we review briefly the unequal outcomes of schooling. This is followed by an assessment of how and why schools differentiate the education of low income students, and not necessarily in a direction that improves their relative situation. The final part of the paper illustrates two dramatic interventions that seem to show positive results in improving the relative educational outcomes of low income students and the policy implications for their expansion.

            "description": "<p>The focus of this essay is on two elements of the Title I reform legislation that conform closely to the civil rights struggle in education of the last half of the twentieth century and that present new opportunities that might otherwise be foreclosed. The first element empowers parents. This power is derived from the provisions of the No Child Left Behind Act that require school authorities to permit parents whose children attend failing schools to transfer to other better performing schools. Properly implemented, this right to transfer can serve as a means for reducing racial and socioeconomic isolation and achieving for some children the goals of desegregation. The second element seeks to place greater responsibility on states to help local education agencies and schools carry out the duties, for example, of providing high quality teachers, imposed by the law. In many ways, the provision mirrors the &ldquo;adequacy&rdquo; approach state litigation challenging school finance systems has taken in recent years. To the extent these provisions of Title I can be made effective, they will provide a remedy in states where litigation has not been successful.

But based on our close observation of the New Accountability at work in Texas, Kentucky, and Community District 2 in New York City&mdash;observations we describe in detail in a companion study&mdash;we are convinced that this method of organizing schools offers the best hope of improved educational outcomes for those most neglected by the current school system. Either the states are getting flexibility without giving anything in return&mdash;in which case the NCLB amounts to the deregulation of federal funds spent on education, which in turn delivers students, particularly poor and minority students, into the hands of selfish local oligarchs&mdash;or, the standards and accountability system are real enough, but are not actually intended to achieve reform. For example, the Cross City Campaign for Urban School Reform, an alliance of school reform organizations in Baltimore, Chicago, Denver, New York, Oakland, and other major cities, is defining indicators of school improvement that reflect the &ldquo;reciprocal accountability&rdquo; of community activists and professional reformers in the new setting of standards-based reform.

            "description": "<p>In footnote eleven of the Brown opinion, the Supreme Court famously cited social science evidence in support of the proposition that segregated schools harmed African-American students. This footnote ignited a debate over both the quality of the research cited and the extent to which it influenced the outcome of the case. While this tired debate continues today, little has been said about the significance of social science evidence in contemporary desegregation cases. These cases concern the dismantling of desegregation decrees and the constitutionality of voluntary integration plans. This Essay argues that the influence of social science evidence depends on three factors: the legal standards applied, the nature and strength of the social science evidence presented, and the nature of the issues presented. For both sets of modern desegregation cases, each of these factors points against the likelihood that social science evidence plays much of a role in determining the outcomes of the cases. After discussing the two main sets of modern desegregation cases, this Essay explores the potential role of social science evidence in related challenges to socioeconomic integration plans, state-based claims for integrated schools, and disparate impact claims under Title VI regulations. Although these programs and legal claims may offer slightly more room for social science evidence to play an influential role, this Essay argues that the ability of social science evidence to influence the outcome of any relevant court decisions remains fairly limited.

            "description": "<p>The landmark case of <em>Brown v. Board of Education</em> set in motion a process of desegregation across the nation that was to benefit society as a whole. It is the opinion of many that the attempts at desegregation have failed. While there were great advances in desegregation early on, many unfortunate steps towards resegregation have been made during the last few decades. While the blame lies in many places for the reversal of desegregation, Professor Chemerinsky argues that &ldquo;Supreme Court decisions over the last 30 years have substantially contributed to the resegregation that Orfield and others document.&rdquo; Part I of his paper deals with the affects of Supreme Court decisions of the 1970s on the process of resegregation. Part II covers Supreme Court decision of the 1990s in which he believes ended desegregation. In Part III Chemerinsky discusses why these events have occurred in the first place. Ultimately, &ldquo;desegregation will not occur without judicial action.&rdquo; This article was previously published in the <em>North Carolina Law Review</em>, Vol. 81, Issue 4 (May 2003), pp. 1597-1622.

            "description": "<p>This paper examines student resegregation by race and socioeconomic class, high stakes accountability measures aimed at affecting educators&rsquo; decisions on student promotion and graduation, and continuing disparities in school resources and finance, all of which intensified in 2002, particularly in North Carolina and the U.S. south. The paper asserts that without careful planning, their simultaneous convergence threatens to derail public education. It discusses the new constraint on race-conscious student assignments suggesting that, absent some contrary Supreme Court decision or extraordinary efforts by southern school boards to circumvent its impact, this ban will recreate levels of racial and socioeconomic isolation not experienced since the 1960s. Section 1, &ldquo;School Racial Composition: The Legal and Demographic Realities in North Carolina,&rdquo; discusses the Supreme Court&rsquo;s changing rulings, the ban on race-conscious student assignments, the demographic future of North Carolina&rsquo;s public schools without race-conscious assignments, and the adverse educational impact of racial resegregation. Section 2, &ldquo;School Accountability: Unintended Consequences?&rdquo; discusses the development of the accountability approach, North Carolina&rsquo;s commitment to accountability, and the likely impact of high stakes testing in resegregating schools. Section 3 examines &ldquo;School Finance/Resource Inequities: While Major Reforms are Educationally Necessary, Will They Prove Sufficient, and Can Political Will be Sustained?&rdquo; This article was previously published in the <em>North Carolina Law Review</em>, Vol. 81, Issue 4 (May 2003), pp. 1375-1426.

Focusing on the Harriet and Henderson Cotton Mills, he shows that workers valued the Textile Workers Union of America for more than the higher wages and improved benefits it secured for them. Members also placed great importance on union-instituted grievance and arbitration procedures, which most labor historians have seen as impediments rather than improvements. Based on complete access to company archives and transcripts of grievance hearings, this case study recasts our understanding of labor-management relations in the postwar South.</p>"
