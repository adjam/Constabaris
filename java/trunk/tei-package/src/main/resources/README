This directory is automatically created and used by a Java
web application that runs XProc pipelines in order to generate
ingest packages for the "Publishing the Long Civil Rights Movement"
(LCRM) project.

Subdirectories within this directory generally correlate with user
sessions, so in general it is safe to delete subdirectories unless
someone is using the application.
